            <p>Hello world! My name is Laurel and I'm from San Diego, CA. I currently serve as full-time Development Manager for <a href="https://www.jointheleague.org/" target="_blank">The LEAGUE of Amazing Programmers</a>, a local nonprofit coding school for kids in grades 5-12. My role at the LEAGUE centers around partnership development and fundraising—not software development. During a recent COVID-19 temporary layoff, I began looking into training programs to bolster my professional skillset. The search eventually led me to the two-week <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/" target="_blank">Frontend Masters Bootcamp,</a> which resulted in this portfolio website!</p>
        
            <p>Over the past few years, working in the nonprofit sector has piqued my interest in web design and development. I've encountered countless websites in need of updating or, in many cases, a complete overhaul. As our world goes increasingly online, having a sub-par website or app is no longer an option for any organization. I am passionate about coding as a vehicle for empowering communities to shape their own stories and I'm eager to help folks up their digital presence through the application of responsive design principles. I'm also interested in collaborative approaches to problem solving such as Mob and Pair Programming, which I believe are the future of web development.</p>
