            <p>Hello world! My name is Laurel and I'm from San Diego, CA.  Until recently, I served as full-time Development Manager for <a href="https://www.jointheleague.org/" target="_blank">The LEAGUE of Amazing Programmers</a>, a local nonprofit coding school for kids in grades 5-12. My role at the LEAGUE centered around partnership development and fundraising—not software development. When I received news that I'd been temporarily laid-off due to COVID-19, I immediately began looking into training programs to bolster my professional skillset. The search eventually led me to the two-week <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/" target="_blank">Frontend Masters Bootcamp</a>.</p>
        
            <p>Over the past few years, working in the nonprofit sector has piqued my interest in web design and development. I've encountered countless websites in need of updating or, in many cases, a complete overhaul. As our world goes increasingly online, having a sub-par website or app is no longer an option for any organization. I am eager to help companies and individuals hit the refresh button and up their digital presence to a new level through the application of responsive design principles. I'm also interested in collaborative approaches to problem solving such as Mob and Pair Programming, which I believe are the future of web development.</p>
