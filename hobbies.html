            <p>When I'm not nerding out on my new coding obsession, I enjoy many hobbies in my free time, not the least of which include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#music" id="firstlink">Singing and playing the guitar</a></li>
                <li>Listening to music</li>
                <li>Learning (spoken) languages</li>
                <li>Hiking</li>
                <li>Traveling to remote places</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The coldest temperature I have ever experienced was -40°C while ice fishing in central Russia—see photo on right. At that point, Celcius and Farenheight converge! I wore two coats over a down parka, two pair of gloves, a couple layers of long underwear...you get the picture.<br> (Note: we didn't manage to catch any fish as the net kept sticking to the bottom of the ice, but we did drink considerable amounts of vodka to stay warm.)</p>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6j9XPNq.png" alt="Laurel & Brandon playing Bossa Nova standards" title="Laurel & Brandon play Bossa Nova">

            <p>I started taking guitar lessons at <a href="https://www.mozeguitars.com/" target="_blank">Moze Guitars</a> in La Mesa in 2017 with the goal of learning to play the blues. It was there I met classical guitarist Brandon Cruz and, together, we discovered a passion for bossa nova. The first song we recorded was a Brazilian standard called <a href= "https://youtu.be/k_D7hWYIeVw" target="_blank">"Carinhoso"</a>, written in 1917 by Pixinguinha (Alfredo Vianna) with lyrics by João de Barro.</p>

            <p>I love the low-key nature of bossa nova. It's a deceptively simple genre; underneath the relaxed lounge vibe are complex rhythms and exotic harmonies. Whereas most pop songs consist of 3-5 chords, bossa nova can have upwards of 30 chords (not including chord variations) in a single piece. Take for example <a href="https://youtu.be/BUj1-xNgjGw" target="_blank">"Corcovado"</a>, with its lilting melody and soft accompaniment. This song has 17 unique chords!</p>
    
            <p>One of my favorite Brazilian duos of all-time is Nara Leão and Roberto Menescal. I dig absolutely <em>everything</em> about this vintage performance of <a href="https://youtu.be/5qVY8DEbbkE" target="_blank">"O barquinho", "O pato", and "Manhã de carnaval"</a>—down to Nara's chic haircut and white overalls. I secretly hope Brandon and I get reincarnated as this couple.
